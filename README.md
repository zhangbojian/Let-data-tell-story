Introduction

Cyber security is an essential issue for the overall security of a country. Cybersecurity is not only about technology, but also about laws and strategies. However, analyzing cybersecurity strategy documents is difficult because it requires knowledge of multiple domains.
With the help of text analytics methods, the documents can be understood more easily, automatically, and efficiently. 
This project conducts machine-learning based text analytics of national cybersecurity strategies. 
The research objects are the cyber security strategies files of 76 countries in the world. 

Problem Statement

Build a tool to analyze the text data of Cybersecurity strategies of different countries to generalize their topics, classify each sentence and assign it with a tag of category.

Data Description

80 pdf documents about Cybersecurity strategic of different countries, given by Unite Ideas in the United Nation’s website.
193 pdf documents of Cyberwellness profiles, downloaded from International Telecommunications Union.
Source Link:  https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Cybersecurity/Pages/Country_Profiles.aspx

Methodology

As the amateurs of Cyber Security, this project uses the methodology on the right pane to detect the hidden values and insights behind the raw text data. That is let the text data tell a story.

Sentence Tokenization
Before sentence tokenization, the tedious text data is removed, including “contents”, “appendix”, table titles, figure titles etc. 
Sentence recognition rules are built. For example, it is regulated that the sentences beginning with numbers, ending with “.”,“;”, and character number less than 50 or the specific value depending on the situation can be regarded as one sentence. 
After the meticulous process, there are 4980 sentences with full and clear meanings are selected. 

Semi-supervised machine learning model
The external text data could not promote the classification process very well.
In order to fully utilize the internal resources, the International Telecommunications Union profiles are adopted to extract the initial dictionary. 
Semi-supervised machine learning algorithm can benefit the text mining procedure by multi-times learning and optimization. 
There are two rules should be satisfied together for the sentence classification according to the probabilities generated by the model:
     (1) Probabilities must larger than 0.5
     (2) Probabilities must larger than 99 percentile
